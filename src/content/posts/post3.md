Hold on. "Beyond the ordinary" doesn't seem so hard. And it isn't. But few of us clear even this low hurdle. I think it's partly because we think of epic as unattainable so we don’t even try. And some achievements certainly seem to be beyond our grasp. I say they're beyond our current grasp. They're outside our ordinary by a wide margin. Outside today's normal, but not outside our capacity to grow. If we strive to expand what we consider to be normal we can do EPIC things.


I challenge you to do something beyond your ordinary. At first only by a small amount, but increasingly so over time. I'd like you to take, if you'll excuse the horrible oxymoron, one small, epic step at a time, until you can look back at some of your accomplishments and say to yourself "That was EPIC!".
