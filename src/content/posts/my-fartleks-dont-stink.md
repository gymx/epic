Do you need to add some variety to your running but don’t like the idea of overly structured workouts? Do you want to improve your speed and endurance but aren’t sure where to start? You may need to let loose some fartleks.
A fartlek is an unstructured workout that’s meant to help you improve your fitness level and improve your VO2max. They’re extremely easy to work into your training and don’t require any preparation. You can do them on a track, road, or trail.  

If you have a solid base of training with consistent training runs – running 30 minutes or more three or four days a week, you could benefit from this type of workout. Fartlek is a Swedish word meaning “speed play” and that’s as good a description as any. Begin a session with a warmup. Whatever distance or time it takes you to feel loose and relaxed while you’re running at an easy pace. Then, pick a tree, pole, sign, or rock not far away and run at a faster pace than normal until you reach it. If it’s close you may do an all out sprint, if it’s a bit farther maybe you’ll break into your 5k pace or mile pace. Something that’s challenging but still lets you keep an even pace through your goal. After you reach your goal, revert to your previous pace until your heart rate and breathing settle back to their normal running rates. Then do it again. Maybe farther this time, or shorter and a bit faster, whatever feels right to you. Then rest again. Walk if you have to in order to recover. It doesn’t have to be an all-out sprint, and probably shouldn’t be, but you should be breathing hard at the end of each one. Repeat three or four times, mixing up the distance and pace each time. Once you’re more fit you can increase the number of fartleks. It’s not meant to be a structured workout, like 400 meter intervals, or mile repeats. It’s supposed to be free-form, spontaneous, and fun. Chase a squirrel. Try to catch a rabbit. Have some fun. After your last one do a mile or two cool-down.  

If you do fartleks as the middle portion of your run once a week your overall aerobic capacity will improve. You’re improving your running efficiency, which will allow you to run at a faster pace for longer periods at the same perceived effort level.  

Give it a try. Let me know how it goes.
